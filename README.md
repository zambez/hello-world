Hello World repository 


Zambez here,

I'm a student at Florida State University studying Economics and Data Science. I'm still new to the world of Data Science and IT in general. SAS, SQL, Stata, SPSS, Teradata, and Tabeleau are the softwares I've been working with but I hope to expand into other areas as well. Hoping to start some data projects soon to build my portfolio and begin my career.
